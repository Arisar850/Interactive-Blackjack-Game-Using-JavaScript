# Interactive-Blackjack-Game-Using-JavaScript
I developed this Blackjack game as part of my front-end development journey using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players draw cards aiming for a total of 21â€”reaching 21 wins, exceeding 21 results in a loss. This project helped me practice JavaScript to create an interactive experience while improving my coding skills.
